They did the Match!  They did the Monster Match!  (The Monster Match)  It was a GM smash!

This alias is designed for GMs to easily find monsters that share similarities, in the hopes you can keep your combats fresh!

Enter a monster's name by itself, or monster name in quotes followed by other arguments like: Type (`-type`), Alignment (`-align`), CR (`-cr`), XP (`-xp`) or Environment (`-env`).

Examples:
`!monmatch red dragon`

`!monmatch "red dragon" -env mountain`

`!monmatch -xp 425`
_ _
You can even upload a CritterDB json of your homebrew Bestiary to a gvar and add it to the lookup (provided the Bestiary is about 25 monsters or less due to gvar limits)
